# Quick start

## Introduction

Generally, atom-shell enables you to create desktop applications with pure
JavaScript by providing a runtime with rich native APIs. You could see it as
a variant of the Node.js runtime which is focused on desktop applications
instead of web servers.

It doesn't mean atom-shell is a JavaScript binding to GUI libraries. Instead,
atom-shell uses web pages as its GUI, so you could also see it as a minimal
Chromium browser, controlled by JavaScript.

### The browser side

If you have experience with Node.js web applications, you will know that there
are two types of JavaScript scripts: the server side scripts and the client side
scripts. Server-side JavaScript is that which runs on the Node.js
runtime, while client-side JavaScript runs inside the user's browser.

In atom-shell we have similar concepts: Since atom-shell displays a GUI by
showing web pages, we have **scripts that run in the web page**, and also
**scripts run by the atom-shell runtime**, which creates those web pages.
Like Node.js, we call them **client scripts**, and **browser scripts**
(meaning the browser replaces the concept of the server here).

In traditional Node.js applications, communication between server and
client is usually facilitated via web sockets. In atom-shell, we have provided
the [ipc](../api/ipc-renderer.md) module for browser to client
communication, and the [remote](../api/remote.md) module for easy RPC
support.

### Web page and Node.js

Normal web pages are designed to not reach outside of the browser, which makes
them unsuitable for interacting with native systems. Atom-shell provides Node.js
APIs in web pages so you can access native resources from web pages, just like
[Node-Webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit).

But unlike Node-Webkit, you cannot do native GUI related operations in web
pages. Instead you need to do them on the browser side by sending messages to
it, or using the easy [remote](../api/remote.md) module.


## Write your first atom-shell app

Generally, an atom-shell app would be structured like this (see the
[hello-atom](https://github.com/dougnukem/hello-atom) repo for reference):

```text
your-app/
├── package.json
├── main.js
└── index.html
```

The format of `package.json` is exactly the same as that of Node's modules, and
the script specified by the `main` field is the startup script of your app,
which will run on the browser side. An example of your `package.json` might look
like this:

```json
{
  "name"    : "your-app",
  "version" : "0.1.0",
  "main"    : "main.js"
}
```

The `main.js` should create windows and handle system events, a typical
example being:

```javascript
var app = require('app');  // Module to control application life.
var BrowserWindow = require('browser-window');  // Module to create native browser window.

// Report crashes to our server.
require('crash-reporter').start();

// Keep a global reference of the window object, if you don't, the window will
// be closed automatically when the javascript object is GCed.
var mainWindow = null;

// Quit when all windows are closed.
app.on('window-all-closed', function() {
  if (process.platform != 'darwin')
    app.quit();
});

// This method will be called when atom-shell has done everything
// initialization and ready for creating browser windows.
app.on('ready', function() {
  // Create the browser window.
  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({width: 800, height: 600});

  // and load the index.html of the app.
  mainWindow.loadUrl('file://' + __dirname + '/index.html');

  // Emitted when the window is closed.
  mainWindow.on('closed', function() {
    // Dereference the window object, usually you would store windows
    // in an array if your app supports multi windows, this is the time
    // when you should delete the corresponding element.
    mainWindow = null;
  });
});
```

Finally the `index.html` is the web page you want to show:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    We are using node.js <script>document.write(process.version)</script>
    and atom-shell <script>document.write(process.versions['atom-shell'])</script>.
  </body>
</html>
```

## Run your app

After you're done writing your app, you can create a distribution by
following the [Application distribution](./application-distribution.md) guide
and then execute the packaged app. You can also just use the downloaded
atom-shell binary to execute your app directly.

On Windows:

```cmd
$ .\atom-shell\atom.exe your-app\
```

On Linux:

```bash
$ ./atom-shell/atom your-app/
```

On Mac OS X:

```bash
$ ./Atom.app/Contents/MacOS/Atom your-app/
```

`Atom.app` here is part of the atom-shell's release package, you can download
it from [here](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/releases).
