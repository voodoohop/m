React Packery Mixin
===================

#### Introduction:
A mixin for React.js to use Metafizzy Packery

#### Usage:

* The mixin is bundled with packery, so no additional dependencies needed!
* You can optionally include Packery as a script tag as an override
`<script src='//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/packery/1.3.0/packery.pkgd.min.js' />`

* To use the mixin
 * require the mixin
 * pass a reference and a packery options object
 * make sure you use the same reference as `ref` in your component
 * if you need to - access the packery object through `this.packery` in your component

* example use in code

```js
/** @jsx React.DOM */
 
'use strict';
 
var React = require('react');
 
var PackeryMixin = require('react-packery-mixin');
 
var packeryOptions = {
    transitionDuration: 0
};
 
module.exports = React.createClass({
    displayName: 'SomeComponent',
 
    mixins: [PackeryMixin('packeryContainer', packeryOptions)],
 
    render: function () {
        var childElements = this.props.elements.map(function(element){
           return (
                <div className="someclass">
                    {element.name}
                </div>
            );
        });
        
        return (
            <div ref="packeryContainer">
                {childElements}
            </div>
        );
